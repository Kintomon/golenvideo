Galène 0.2 (unreleased)

  * Error handling has been improved.  In particular, group operators now
    receive a friendly warning when recording to disk fails for some reason.
  * Recording to disk now works on Windows too.
  * The play from disk button is not available when the browser doesn't
    support the required API.  We used to display a cryptic error message
    in that case.
  * The stream abort protocol message is now supported in the client->server
    direction, making it possible for the client to reject a stream.
  * It is now possible to configure a group to use codecs such as VP9 and
    H.264.  The default is still to use VP8 and Opus, as this yields the
    best compatibility across browsers.  Only VP8, VP9 and Opus can be
    saved to disk.
  * The delay before sending NACKs has been reduced, which gives a major
    boost in video quality.
  * The command-line option -insecure allows using plain HTTP, which is
    useful when running behind a reverse proxy.
  * The client-server protocol has been reworked to be more symmetric and
    more secure.  It is now documented in the file README.PROTOCOL.
  * It is now possible to generate TURN passwords automatically, which
    avoids leaking long-term TURN credentials.
  * The command-line option "-relay-only" can be used to specify that all
    media traffic should go through a TURN server.
  * The ICE configuration will now be checked periodically, and new
    clients will use an updated configuration.
  * When saving to disk to disk, the keyframe interval has been reduced to 4s.
  * We now work around a limitation of the Go runtime that used to cause
    a crash on 32-bit architectures.
