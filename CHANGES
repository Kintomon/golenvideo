Galène 0.2 (unreleased)

  * Error handling has been improved.  In particular, group operators now
    receive a friendly warning when recording to disk fails for some reason.
  * Recording to disk now works on Windows too.
  * The play from disk button is not available when the browser doesn't
    support the required API.  We used to display a cryptic error message
    in that case.
  * The stream abort protocol message is now supported in the client->server
    direction, making it possible for the client to reject a stream.
  * It is now possible to configure a group to use codecs such as VP9 and
    H.264.  The default is still to use VP8 and Opus, as this yields the
    best compatibility across browsers.
  * The delay before sending NACKs has been reduced, which gives a major
    boost in video quality.
  * Fixed a crash on 32-bit architectures due to unaligned atomic memory
    operations.

19 December 2020: Galène 0.1

  * Initial release.
